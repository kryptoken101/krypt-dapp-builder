# dApp Builder

The purpose of dApp Builder is to bring smart contract technology to the business users who do not necessarily have the technical know-how to create smart contract. dApp Builder allows you to create dApps, customize their frontend and use them both on your desktop and on your mobile device using the [dApp Widget](https://github.com/iBuildApp/dApp-Builder/tree/master/dApp%20Widget).
